They have achieved this and produced a language that \"walks like Python and runs like C\".  Julia \"walks like Python\", because it is not necessary to systematically define the type of every variable that appears in the code.  It \"runs like C\" because it is a compiled language, and produces (or rather, can produce) highly efficient machine code.","category":"page"},{"location":"TypeStable.html","page":"Type-stability","title":"Type-stability","text":"Python and MATLAB are examples of interpreted language.  In a pure interpreted language, the type of the variables is computed at run time, at the same time as the value of the variables.  As long as the values of the inputs to the code are known at the top level (in the REPL or the top script), the interpretation infers, step by step the type of the variables, all the way down the call stack. This allows to write functions without specifying types, and this in turn allows to write generic code (for example an iterative solver that works just as well with Float64 and Float32 variables).  The disadvantage is that inferring the type of variables on the fly introduces significant overhead at run time.","category":"page"},{"location":"TypeStable.html","page":"Type-stability","title":"Type-stability","text":"At the other end of the scale C and Fortran are examples of strictly typed compiled languages. Because the source code specifies the type of every variable in the function (both variables in the function interface, and local variables), the compiler can create efficient machine code for each function, just by considering the code of that function alone. The disadvantage is that type declaration takes time to write and clutters the source code, and (unless the language offers \"templates\", as C++ does), it may be necessary to write several methods, identical in all but types of variables, to make an algorithm available to various data types.","category":"page"},{"location":"TypeStable.html#Julia's-approach-to-type-specifications","page":"Type-stability","title":"Julia's approach to type specifications","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"TypeStable.html","page":"Type-stability","title":"Type-stability","text":"Julia takes the sweet spot in between, not requiring to specify the type of each variable, yet producing fast machine code. The trick is as follows: every time a method is called (so, at run time), with a combination of concrete types of arguments that has not yet been encountered for this method, the compiler quicks in.  A \"concrete type\" is the information returned by typeof() when called on a variable.  One example is Float64.  This is as opposed to an abstract type, like Real, which is a set of concrete types, and includes Float64 and Float32.

The compiler will produce a method instance (or instance, for short), which is machine code for this combination. One interesting implication is that writing strictly typed method interfaces in Julia does not provide any improvement of machine code performance: the compiler takes the type of the arguments from the calling context anyway. A strictly typed interface has the disadvantage of offering no flexibility. A method that only accepts a Vector will not accept other vector-like things like a SubArray (an array view), a Adjoint (a transposed array), a SparseMatrix or a StaticArray, even thought the method probably implements an algorithm that would compile perfectly well for all of these.","category":"page"},{"location":"TypeStable.html","page":"Type-stability","title":"Type-stability","text":"However, providing partial specification of the type of the arguments of a method serves important purposes in Julia:","category":"page"},{"location":"TypeStable.html","page":"Type-stability","title":"Type-stability","text":"If a function has several methods, it allows to specify which method should be executed (multiple dispatch).

In FEM-optimization, the FEM model is used to express the response as a function of unknow loads and/or model parameters.  This in turn allows to reexpress the target function in terms of unknow loads and/or model parameters: we now have an unconstrained optimization problem. One advantage of this approach is that it can be implemented using existing FEM software: The FEM software  is evaluated repeatedly by an optimization algorithm (FEM in the loop).  Such an implementation is useful in many applications, but it does not scale well to large numbers of parameters to optimize.  For example, this is not a good solution to identify the load history that must have acted on a dynamic structure to cause the response that has been partialy measured. Further, it is not easily applicable to problems in which the FEM model alone is indetermined because what would otherwise be specified as initial or boundary conditions is to be determined from the measurement data (See the model identification example above, where initial conditions were not provided as input).","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"The second approach to constrained optimization is to use Lagrange multipliers (also known in this context as adjoint state variables).  This approach requires dedicated solvers, and dedicated systems for the assembly of gradient vectors and Hessian matrices. Muscade provides such solvers (and more are to be added in the near future).  The \"Lagrange multiplier\"-approach also requires that elements provide partial derivatives and internal results to the solution algorithms, in a way that is not easily achievable within the architecture of existing FEM software. As a consequence, in Muscade, all element types required to model a given physical system need to be reimplemented, which is a serious drawback.  However, thanks to careful design of Muscade, as well as to the capabilities provided by the Julia programming language, implementing elements is significantly easier than it would be within a classical FE software.
